    <p>
      Fourth Step Inventory is a private journaling app designed to help users
      examine resentments, patterns, and character defects using a structured
      Fourth Step–style inventory.
    </p>

    <p>
      All entries are stored locally on your device. The app does not transmit,
      upload, or share any personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      This app is inspired by traditional 12-step inventory practices but is
      not affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous or any other fellowship.

    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      Fourth Step Inventory does not collect, transmit, store, or share any
      personal data outside of your device.
    </p>

    <p>
      All information you enter into the app is stored locally on your device
      using standard system storage. The app does not use analytics, tracking,

    <p>
      The app does not require account creation, sign-in, or network access
      to function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because data is stored locally, privacy depends on the security of your
